&lt;p&gt;An unconventional and compassionate guide to becoming an early bird&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I was destined to be a night owl forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m no stranger to reading about the benefits of waking up early or having the same sleeping routine — all of us have probably read this at some point in our lives. I’m in my final semester of university, so the past few years of my life have been absolute chaos. I have classes some days, work other days, and have free time on especially rare days. Having a routine seemed impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a few months ago, I started reading &lt;span class=&#34;exturl&#34; data-url=&#34;aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvSGFydWtpX011cmFrYW1p&#34;&gt;Haruki Murakami&lt;/span&gt;’s novels. My favorite is &lt;span class=&#34;exturl&#34; data-url=&#34;aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZHJlYWRzLmNvbS9ib29rL3Nob3cvMTEyOTcuTm9yd2VnaWFuX1dvb2Q=&#34;&gt;Norwegian Wood&lt;/span&gt;. Inspired by Murakami’s fascinating prose, I researched him a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this gem in a &lt;span class=&#34;exturl&#34; data-url=&#34;aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcGFyaXNyZXZpZXcub3JnL2ludGVydmlld3MvMi9oYXJ1a2ktbXVyYWthbWktdGhlLWFydC1vZi1maWN0aW9uLW5vLTE4Mi1oYXJ1a2ktbXVyYWthbWk=&#34;&gt;2004 interview&lt;/span&gt; he did:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I’m in writing mode for a novel, I get up at 4 a.m. and work for five to six hours. In the afternoon, I run for ten kilometers or swim for fifteen hundred meters (or do both), then I read a bit and listen to some music. I go to bed at 9 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep to this routine every day without variation. The repetition itself becomes the important thing; it’s a form of mesmerism. I mesmerize myself to reach a deeper state of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to hold to such repetition for so long — six months to a year — requires a good amount of mental and physical strength. In that sense, writing a long novel is like survival training. Physical strength is as necessary as artistic sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s something about the way Murakami talks about his routine that moved me. This part, in particular, stood out to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The repetition itself becomes the important thing; it’s a form of mesmerism.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mesmerism has been a part of my life since I was a child; it’s the sense I have every time I establish a new habit. I mesmerized myself as a child to brush my teeth every day in the morning. As an adult, I’ve mesmerized myself to be healthy by exercising regularly. I’ve mesmerized myself to reflect on my life by adding a journaling routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A surge of motivation struck me, knowing I had done a similar task in the past. I could become an early bird by mesmerizing myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past 3 months, I’ve successfully transitioned into being an early bird. I go to sleep at 9 p.m. on average 6-7 nights a week. I currently wake up between 5–5:30 a.m. naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might continue experimenting with waking up even earlier, but I’m happy with my current routine and don’t want to put too much pressure on myself. After all, it’s healthy to get 8 hours of sleep, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried to become an early bird many times in my life and this is the first time it has actually worked. Here’s what this process of “mesmerizing” myself looked like—and also a few words about what doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really worked was more gentle than you might expect. Consider this, then, a compassionate guide to waking up early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;clarify-your-purpose-for-waking-up-early&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#clarify-your-purpose-for-waking-up-early&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 🌟 Clarify Your Purpose for Waking Up Early&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waking up before everyone else is tough. If you don’t have a reason to do it, you won’t do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t just mean purpose in the sense that you want to wake up to do something. Of course, you’re going to wake up early to do something (probably productive). But you need a purpose that extends past a basic task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m about to graduate from university and I’m about to enter arguably the most important years of my life — years where I’ll have both money and freedom. If I ever want a chance at escaping at the 9–5, I have to do something now. Working in the morning is easier than working at night, so I need to set up my habits now so I can be living that life later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might already have a purpose, but if you don’t, try running a &lt;span class=&#34;exturl&#34; data-url=&#34;aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvNV9XaHlz&#34;&gt;5 Whys&lt;/span&gt; analysis (otherwise known as root cause analysis).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do the &lt;em&gt;5 Whys&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Form a problem statement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask the question: “Why is/are/does [your problem statement]?”. Use your answer as the next problem statement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep asking “why” until you’ve asked it five or more times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to wake up at 5 a.m. every day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do you want to wake up at 5 a.m. every day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want more time to be productive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do you want to be more productive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to practice writing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do you want to practice writing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to write books.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do you want to write books?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to have a career doing something creative.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do you want to have a career doing something creative?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I imagine it to be the most fulfilling thing someone can do in their career.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with a smaller problem and going deep to find the root cause helps you gain a better understanding of what you really want. It’ll help you understand if waking up is part of the solution to your problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waking up early gives you a few hours every day in the morning where nobody else is going to disturb you. That’s all it is for most of us. For me, though, that’s an important part of my solution to escaping a 9–5 rut and doing work I love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;understand-what-you-gain-and-lose&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#understand-what-you-gain-and-lose&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 💪 Understand What You Gain and Lose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first tried to become an early riser, I didn’t consider what I have to give up. I failed because I wasn’t willing to give up the things I enjoyed, like my weekday social life. I would go out, say I’d wake up early despite getting home late, and ultimately wake up late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you accept what you lose upfront, you won’t keep trying to hold onto it when it’s gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let’s be optimistic and start with what you’ll gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-you-gain&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#what-you-gain&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; What you gain&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being an early bird means you get a few hours every day to do whatever you want. It’s likely nobody else will be awake to disturb you. You can paint, start a business, write — anything you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your prefrontal cortex is most active right after waking up, making it optimal for creativity. I’ve noticed I write much faster in the morning than at any other time in the day. Looking at the habits of famous writers, a lot of them have figured it out too (most authors write in the morning).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a big win: a few hours of solitude with your most creative self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-you-lose&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#what-you-lose&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; What you lose&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no free lunch. Waking up early doesn’t give you extra time. It takes off time you would otherwise have at night — unless you sleep less, which is a bad idea. If you sleep less, you either won’t be able to wake up early and become a night owl again, or you’ll be sleep-deprived and unproductive throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, I lost time since I started waking up early. I used to sleep for 6 hours and wake up from the urgency to get up and get to work. I can’t do that when I’m waking up early because there’s no urgency for me to get out of bed; I’m weak. So I sleep for 8 hours. Otherwise, the temptation to stay in bed would be too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve lost around 2 hours every day—but I feel rested throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;running-out-of-time&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#running-out-of-time&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Running out of time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finish work at 5 p.m. (haha, 9–5). That means I have 4 hours after work before I sleep. But there are a few things I need to do within that time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commute (1 hour)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cook and eat (1 hour)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise (1 hour)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wind down (1 hour)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That adds up to 4 hours. There’s no time left to do anything else. Of course, these activities don’t always take an hour each, but you get the point. Winding down is especially important for me. I tried a lot of ways to get around it, but I ended up not being able to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep my sanity, I have dinner with friends on days I don’t exercise. Still, there’s a limited time I can spend with them (around 2 hours).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels like I’m living in a box, but I can’t say it’s all been bad. Being able to keep up this habit makes me feel eccentric and in some way, special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to watch the &lt;span class=&#34;exturl&#34; data-url=&#34;aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g/dj1UUkdDTmxrNFJTMA==&#34;&gt;life of bodybuilders&lt;/span&gt; and wonder how they do it; all they do is eat, train and sleep. They don’t do anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I understand them. There’s a sense of purpose that comes with living in a box. You know you’re disciplining yourself for a goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;give-yourself-one-day-off-per-week&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#give-yourself-one-day-off-per-week&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Give yourself one day off per week&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve found that if I mess up my sleep schedule one day a week, I can still maintain it throughout the week. I tried sleeping late two or three days a week — it didn’t work. But one seems to be okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love going out at night, so I’ve given myself one day a week (usually Friday) to hang out with friends for longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is something you need to do to wake up early, I suggest you set rules for it, too. You’re less likely to fail with disciplined chaos than pure chaos. Give yourself one day a week where you’re allowed to break the rules to mitigate what you feel you are losing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;compare-the-benefits-with-the-cost&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#compare-the-benefits-with-the-cost&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Compare the benefits with the cost&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself these two questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What will I gain with the extra time in the morning?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What will I lose with the lost time at night?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then ask yourself: “Do the benefits outweigh the costs?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they don’t, then there’s probably no point in waking up early. If they do, there are a few things that helped me that’ll probably help you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;focus-on-sleeping-time&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#focus-on-sleeping-time&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 😴 Focus on Sleeping Time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I told myself I was going to wake up at 5 a.m. no matter what, I failed. I’d do it if I slept too late. I’d do it if I stayed out late at night. I’d do it if I stayed up studying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This didn’t work. I don’t know what I was trying to do by trying to cheat the system, thinking my willpower was enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might work for people who have this habit already. But if you’re starting out, focus on one thing: sleeping time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;get-enough-sleep&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#get-enough-sleep&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Get enough sleep&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common mistake people make is thinking they can sleep the same amount as they usually do. For example, I only slept for 6 hours before, so I thought I could sleep for 6 hours and still wake up early. This doesn’t work because you end up sleeping in; it’s unlikely you have any willpower when it’s pitch black outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the best chances at waking up early, set a goal for 8 hours of sleep. I want to wake up at 5 a.m., so my sleeping time is 9 p.m. (8 hours before).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sleep-more-than-needed-when-you-start&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#sleep-more-than-needed-when-you-start&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Sleep more than needed (when you start)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started, I didn’t set my alarm at 5 a.m. I set no alarm at all. With drastic changes to your sleeping schedule, you’re going to need some time to adjust. You initially need more sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have the rest of your life to wake up early. Spend some time now getting the habit into your routine. This is a marathon, not a sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waking up early means waking up when it’s still dark. Give your body some time to adjust to the darkness. It took me about a week; it might be longer or shorter for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I naturally woke up earlier and earlier every day. Now I can successfully wake up at 5 a.m. every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dont-try-to-change-everything&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#dont-try-to-change-everything&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 🌳 Don’t Try to Change Everything&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t introduce too much change to your life at once. Changing your sleeping pattern is a big change. I know you want to wake up and do something productive right away. You want to do all the amazing things you couldn’t do before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be patient. If you don’t, you’re not going to be able to do any amazing things at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;you-cant-change-too-much-at-once&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#you-cant-change-too-much-at-once&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; You can’t change too much at once&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it helps to get some empathy, imagine the life of someone who seriously needs help. An archetype would be the 30-year-old man-child who still lives in his parents’ basement and plays video games all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were giving him life advice, it would be something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix your diet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the gym every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read books.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do a side project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine how they would do that? They can’t do all of these things at once! If you told them to change everything at once, it would be so overwhelming they’d stay in their old habits. You’d have more compassion for them and help them make those changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can barely fix my diet and go to the gym at the same time, and I’d like to consider myself a healthily integrated member of society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, you should only change one thing at a time. For now, focus on getting to sleep early. That’s all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowly increase your productivity as you go. If your goal is to get work done in the morning, start by doing 30 minutes of work, then an hour, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;have-fun-in-the-morning-when-you-start&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#have-fun-in-the-morning-when-you-start&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Have fun in the morning (when you start)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s a day you wake up feeling super motivated and ready to do work, then, by all means, do it. But if you don’t feel motivated at the start, just have fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent around two weeks waking up in the morning and watching TV shows, YouTube or Twitch streams. It was actually fun — watching stuff when nobody else was around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I was ready to do work. Trust me, you’ll eventually be ready to do work. There’s no way you’re going to wake up every morning to mess around for the rest of your life (if your goal is to be productive); it’ll feel like such a waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;choose-a-morning-routine&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#choose-a-morning-routine&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 🌅 Choose a Morning Routine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after waking up early for months, I still have trouble getting out of bed without my morning routine. I tried to skip it a few times, but it felt wrong — as if my morning routine is part of the process of waking up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A morning routine not only prepares you for the day, but it mesmerizes you. Before my routine, I’m groggy and tired. After, I’m excited and awake. It’s the closest thing to magic I’ve found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s like my brain is telling me: “now that you’ve completed the first task of the day, you’re ready to wake up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I journal for my morning routine — specifically, I do morning pages. It’s an exercise from Julia Cameron’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artist’s Way&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where you write 3 longhand pages without stopping to think. It’s designed to unblock artists by teaching them that perfection isn’t necessary to create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of 3 A4 pages, I do 4 A5 pages. I don’t know if they’re the same amount, but the exact amount of words you write doesn’t matter. It’s pretty close though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep a journal and pen next to my bed. They’re the first thing I touch (after turning the lights on) after waking up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-routine-that-suits-you&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#a-routine-that-suits-you&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; A routine that suits you&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might already have a morning routine or have one in mind you want to try. Or you could also do morning pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some other practices I recommend for morning routines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meditation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yoga&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making tea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual routine doesn’t matter — at least for waking up. You’ll get different benefits from different routines but the goal is to help you wake up. You want to teach your body what to do when you wake up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;get-an-alarm-that-works-for-you&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#get-an-alarm-that-works-for-you&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; ⏰ Get an Alarm That Works for You&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s one piece of advice with alarms I would give, it’s this: don’t use an alarm to wake you up; instead, use it as an insurance policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first started using alarms, I used them to try to cheat sleep. When you use alarms this way, you end up waking up groggy and tired because you didn’t get enough sleep in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t want to end up hating your alarm, make sure you set the time to the time after you want to wake up. I set it 8.5 hours after my bedtime and I wake up without it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;experiment-with-alarms&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#experiment-with-alarms&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Experiment with alarms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t experimented with alarms before, you should. Different alarms suit different people. Do a quick Google search for alarms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are all sorts of alarms out there. There are smart alarms, alarms that only work if you step out of your bed, and even phone apps where someone calls you to wake you up. The latter would never work for me, but I can see it working for someone very social.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t want to do your own research, I have a recommendation for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;try-a-light-alarm&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#try-a-light-alarm&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Try a light alarm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use a light alarm. A light alarm wakes you up with light before it wakes you up with sound. It starts shining a light 30 minutes before the time you set and slowly gets brighter and brighter. This is useful for early birds because it’s dark early in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set it at 5:30 a.m., which means it starts shining at 5 a.m. I never wake up to the sound; I always wake up to the light. It hasn’t been easy to create this habit, but since I’ve made sure I get enough sleep first, the light is enough—I never have a jarring sound wake me up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a &lt;span class=&#34;exturl&#34; data-url=&#34;aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TdW5yaXNlLU5hdHVyZS1Tb3VuZHMtQmVkc2lkZS1TaW11bGF0b3IvZHAvQjA3UDI0UkhUSy8=&#34;&gt;link to the alarm I use&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sleep-without-your-phone&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#sleep-without-your-phone&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 📵 Sleep Without Your Phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want a chance at being productive in the morning, you can’t sleep with your phone. It’s already hard to wake up before everyone else. Don’t make it harder for yourself by giving yourself easy access to addictive stimuli while you’re in bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-boring-sleeping-environment&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#a-boring-sleeping-environment&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; A boring sleeping environment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make your sleeping environment as boring as possible. You don’t want to have any excitement before you sleep or after you wake up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common culprit of entertainment in bed is the phone. If you have something else that you love you use in bed like a tablet, I suggest you move that away too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two goals this achieves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improves sleep&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helps with getting out of bed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;no-way-around-it&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#no-way-around-it&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; No way around it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I put my phone in another room, I constantly checked it in bed. I would message my friends. I would check every social media app I had. I would watch YouTube to sleep. I thought it was good because I kept doing it and I was so used to falling asleep with entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as your phone is within reach when you wake up, there’s an incredible temptation to use it in bed. I don’t know about you but I’ve stayed in bed for hours mucking around on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no self-control at all, so I control my environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;put-your-phone-in-another-room&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#put-your-phone-in-another-room&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Put your phone in another room&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a simple idea, but not easy. It feels like you’re giving away your baby. But the resistance is good. It means you’re killing an addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose a room with a place to charge your phone. This could be the living room, kitchen, or in my case, a study room. Leave your phone there and in the morning, check it after you’ve left your bed, not before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;use-melatonin-as-insurance&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#use-melatonin-as-insurance&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 💊 Use Melatonin as Insurance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve left the most controversial for last. If you don’t want to take any substances, you can skip this section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melatonin is a natural hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle. Your body produces it at night to help you sleep. But you can also take it as a pill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get it in the United States without a prescription. Since melatonin is found in some foods, the U.S. Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 allows it to be sold as a dietary supplement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dosage&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#dosage&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Dosage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;span class=&#34;exturl&#34; data-url=&#34;aHR0cDovL25ld3MubWl0LmVkdS8yMDAxL21lbGF0b25pbi0xMDE3&#34;&gt;2001 study&lt;/span&gt; found that the ideal dosage is 0.3 mg. The lowest amount of a melatonin dose I’ve found is 1mg. If you can find 0.3 mg, then good for you. I use 1mg and cut it into half (0.5 mg). It’s not exactly 0.3 mg, but it works for me. I’ve tried different dosages, including up to 10 mg, and none of them worked as well as taking less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;regulate-your-sleep-schedule&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#regulate-your-sleep-schedule&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Regulate your sleep schedule&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t get to sleep on time consistently, melatonin isn’t going to save you. I tried to cheat the system. It didn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, you’re sometimes going to fail. You might sleep too late. You might have a coffee too late in the day. You might wake up in the afternoon and have trouble sleeping early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fail. I’m not a perfectly disciplined monk. When it happens, I take melatonin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though melatonin isn’t considered an addictive substance, be cautious. There’s no evidence melatonin has dangerous effects, but you can build up a tolerance for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My recommendation is to use melatonin when you mess up your sleep schedule and can’t get to sleep at your bedtime because you’re too awake — but don’t allow that to happen too often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said a lot about sleep. That’s because most of waking up early is sleeping early, and it isn’t easy to sleep early. There are sacrifices to be made. If you’re willing to make them, you can become an early bird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are glamorous parts to waking up early. You get to be productive. You get the feeling of accomplishing something before anybody else does. You get hours of solitude in a solitude-deprived, technology-focused world. I love it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;参考&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#参考&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 参考&lt;/h2&gt;

        <title>科普：体检前的注意事项</title>
        <link rel="alternate" href="https://luhuadong.com/healthy/precautions-before-physical-examination.html"/>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;由于每个人的年龄、健康状况不同，因此体检的项目也会略有不同。通常来说，建议在基础体检项目之上，针对性地选择附加检查项目，并且每半年至一年体检时交替更换项目，这样能更好地发挥体检的作用。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;基础项目每个人都要做，主要包括：一般检查（身高、体重、血压、脉搏、腰围）、内外科检查、肾功能、血脂、血糖、血常规、尿常规、肝功能、常规心电图、胸部正侧位片、肝胆脾胰双肾超声等。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;附加项目包括胸部 CT 扫描、甲状腺彩超、HPV 检查（女性专项）、前列腺 B 超（男性专项）、肿瘤筛查等等。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;为了使体检的结果更准确，在体检前一天需要注意以下几点：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;禁止进食&lt;/strong&gt;：体检前一天一般需要空腹 8-10 小时，不能进食，也不能喝水，才能保证结果的准确性，尤其是血液检查和尿液检查的结果。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;禁止喝酒&lt;/strong&gt;：体检前几天不要酗酒，否则会影响肝功能、肾功能、尿常规和血常规等指标。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;避开月经期&lt;/strong&gt;：如果是女性体检，往往需要避开月经期，方便进行妇科检查。另外，也可避免因抽血引起的贫血、低血糖等。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;避免剧烈运动&lt;/strong&gt;：体检前一周左右通常避免剧烈运动，适当休息，防止血液和体液的成分发生改变，影响检查的结果。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;保证饮食清淡&lt;/strong&gt;：建议在体检前三天尽量保证饮食清淡，不要食用过于油腻、辛辣刺激性的食物，保证结果的准确性。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;保证充足睡眠&lt;/strong&gt;：体检前一天要注意休息，不要熬夜，保证充足的睡眠，避免剧烈运动和情绪激动。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;穿宽松的衣服&lt;/strong&gt;：体检当天穿的衣服要宽松，因为做心电图或者做腹部触诊等项目时需要裸露部分肢体。对于女生，最好穿不带钢圈的内衣，因为拍 X 光或者做 CT 等放射性检查时会有影响。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;另外，还有一些比较常见的问题：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;体检前能不能喝水？&lt;/strong&gt; 能不能喝水，要看检查项目。如果有呼气试验、胃肠镜检查等项目，在检查前 4 小时是完全不能喝水的，更不能进食。如果是普通体检，抽血前可以喝少量的水（不超过 200ml 为宜），但只能喝白开水，不能喝饮料、茶水、咖啡等。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;体检前能不能小便？&lt;/strong&gt; 体检当天的早上起来第一泡尿，建议先不要着急的去排尿，因为尿常规留尿，建议留晨尿（晨尿是一天中尿液最浓缩的时候，这样检查的话更容易获取阳性信息）。而且做 B 超需要憋尿，所以如果排尿了，再憋尿就要花很长的时间。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;体检前能不能大便？&lt;/strong&gt; 普通体检之前是可以正常排便的，如果需要留取大便标本，可以在全天任何时间进行留取。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;体检前能不能同房？&lt;/strong&gt; 对于女性来说，体检前几天不能有性行为，因为会影响到妇科检查的结果。对于男性来说，如果没有检查精液有关的项目，性行为不会对检查结果造成影响，但是会影响体检时的精神状态。因此建议体检前一晚好好休息，不要同房。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>如何在 Ubuntu 中使用网络代理</title>
        <link rel="alternate" href="https://luhuadong.com/guide/how-to-use-network-proxy-on-ubuntu.html"/>
        <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&#34;第1步找一个-vpn&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#第1步找一个-vpn&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 第 1 步：找一个 VPN&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;自己去找哦，这里不推荐。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;第2步安装代理工具&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#第2步安装代理工具&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 第 2 步：安装代理工具&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;首先在 &lt;span class=&#34;exturl&#34; data-url=&#34;aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL3NoYWRvd3NvY2tzL3NoYWRvd3NvY2tzLXF0NQ==&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/span&gt; 下载 Shadowsocks-Qt5 软件，例如 Shadowsocks-Qt5-3.0.1-x86_64.AppImage。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;修改权限&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;highlight bash&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;命令行&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;gutter&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;code&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;chmod +x Shadowsocks-Qt5-3.0.1-x86_64.AppImage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;启动程序&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;highlight bash&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;命令行&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;gutter&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;code&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;./Shadowsocks-Qt5-3.0.1-x86_64.AppImage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如果在 Ubuntu 22.04 系统启动失败，可能需要安装一些依赖库，例如：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;highlight bash&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;命令行&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;gutter&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;code&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;sudo apt install libfuse2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;第3步配置网络代理&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#第3步配置网络代理&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 第 3 步：配置网络代理&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;点击菜单栏中的 “连接 -&amp;gt; 添加”，工具提供了多种添加方式，比较方便的是扫描二维码或者导入 URL 自动识别，然后再 “手动” 修改特定参数，比如本地端口号。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;然后点击工具栏第一个 “连接” 图标，如无意外，现在你已经连接到网络代理了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-src=&#34;/images/guide/Shadowsock-Qt5-3.0.1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;第4步在终端使用代理&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#第4步在终端使用代理&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 第 4 步：在终端使用代理&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;为了能在 Shell 终端使用网络代理，我们需要配置一些环境变量。为方便起见，我在这里设置了  &lt;code&gt;ALL_PROXY&lt;/code&gt;  变量，并且在～/.bashrc 文件设置了别名。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;将下面两行命令添加到～/.bashrc 文件即可。值得一提的是，我这里使用的本地端口是 23333，你要根据自己的情况进行修改。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;highlight bash&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;命令行&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;gutter&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;code&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;built_in&#34;&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt; setproxy=&lt;span class=&#34;string&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;export ALL_PROXY=socks5://127.0.0.1:23333&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;built_in&#34;&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt; unsetproxy=&lt;span class=&#34;string&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;unset ALL_PROXY&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;现在，打开一个新的终端，执行  &lt;code&gt;setproxy&lt;/code&gt;  命令配置网络代理。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;然后执行  &lt;code&gt;curl cip.cc&lt;/code&gt;  命令可以查询接入网络的 IP 地址和地区等信息，正常情况下接入的是国内的 IP，例如：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;highlight bash&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;命令行&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;gutter&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;code&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;$ curl cip.cc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;IP	: 61.144.49.139&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;地址	: 中国  广东  广州&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;运营商	: 电信&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;数据二	: 广东省广州市 | 电信&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;数据三	: 中国广东广州 | 电信&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;URL	: http://www.cip.cc/61.144.49.139&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;配置网络代理后，再次执行就会变成其他 IP 地址，例如：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;highlight bash&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;命令行&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;gutter&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;code&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;$ curl cip.cc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;IP	: 60.249.1.178&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;地址	: 中国  台湾  台中市&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;运营商	: cht.com.tw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;数据二	: 台湾省 | 中华电信(HiNet)数据中心&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;数据三	: 中国台湾 | 中华电信&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;URL	: http://www.cip.cc/60.249.1.178&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如果命令执行失败，可以加  &lt;code&gt;-v&lt;/code&gt;  选项查看详细信息，即：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;highlight bash&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;命令行&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;gutter&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;code&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;curl -v cip.cc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;第5步在浏览器中使用代理&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#第5步在浏览器中使用代理&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 第 5 步：在浏览器中使用代理&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;以 Firefox 浏览器为例，打开设置页面，找到 “网络设置” 栏目，选择 “手动配置代理”，如下所示。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-src=&#34;/images/guide/Firefox-network-proxy.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;现在，你应该可以在浏览器中访问 &lt;span class=&#34;exturl&#34; data-url=&#34;aHR0cHM6Ly9nb29nbGUuY29t&#34;&gt;google.com&lt;/span&gt; 了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;第6步在系统中使用代理&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#第6步在系统中使用代理&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 第 6 步：在系统中使用代理&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;打开 Ubuntu 系统的 “设置” 工具，选择 “网络”，你会看到 “网络代理” 一栏，正常情况下处于关闭状态。切换到 “手动” 状态，填写本地网络代理的 IP 和端口信息，如下所示。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-src=&#34;/images/guide/Ubuntu-network-proxy-setting.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;好了，就这样。&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>如何换领居民身份证</title>
        <link rel="alternate" href="https://luhuadong.com/guide/how-to-renew-a-resident-identity-card.html"/>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;身份证还有两个月就要到期了，十年好像一眨眼就过去一样，让人感慨万分。每天打开支付宝、券商 App 之类的应用，都在提醒我 —— “赶紧去换领身份证啊！”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;于是我上网查了一下 “到期如何更换身份证”，主要有三种方式：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;跨市跨省异地换证&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;市内跨区异地换证&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;回户籍所在地换证&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;没想到还挺周到的，居然支持跨市办理了！不过，需要额外提供一些证明资料，还是有点麻烦。于是我就决定趁国庆假期回家一起办了，由于市区距离户籍所在地还有 70 多公里，所以我选择了第 2 种方式 —— 市内跨区办理。这样既不需要开证明材料，也不需要回村里一趟，是个便捷的选择。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-src=&#34;/images/guide/renew-id-card-01.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而且我还发现市区有提供 “自助终端机” 办理，良好市民只需要刷身份证就可以进去了，旁边还有一台自助拍照终端机。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;整个办理流程也很简单：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;拍一张满意的照片，并领取回执单；&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;在自助申办终端机选择 “期满换证”；&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;刷身份证确认办理人身份，并阅读提示信息；&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;扫描相片采集回执上的条形码；&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;人脸比对；&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;核查个人基本信息；&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;采集指纹信息；&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;选择领取方式；&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;缴费。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一波操作下来，不用半小时即可完成。不过由于这个办理点的自助拍照终端机没有启用，所以需要另外找照相馆（也许就是为了照顾附近照相馆的生意吧）。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;费用的话，包括拍照的费用 25 元，办证工本费 20 元，以及邮政快递费 18 元（可选，默认到付），支持微信支付。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img data-src=&#34;/images/guide/renew-id-card-02.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;除了拍照环节不太满意，整个过程还是挺便捷的，毕竟早已进入数字化时代了。相信下一个十年一定会更便捷！加油 &lt;span class=&#34;github-emoji&#34; alias=&#34;running&#34; style=&#34;&#34; fallback-src=&#34;https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f3c3.png?v8&#34;&gt;🏃&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;对了，广东的小伙伴可以在 “粤省事” 查看办理进度。&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>有选择困难症怎么办？三个步骤帮你治好</title>
        <link rel="alternate" href="https://luhuadong.com/guide/fobo.html"/>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-src=&#34;/images/guide/FOBO.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;「&lt;strong&gt;FOBO&lt;/strong&gt;」是 “Fear Of Better Options” 的缩写，即 “更佳选择恐惧症”，也就是我们常说的 “选择困难症”。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这世上到处都有 “重大选择”，有些在过去很简单的选择，比如去哪吃饭，买什么东西… 现在都得仔细斟酌。科技只是让这一问题变得更为明显。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FOBO 会让你过于认真地思考问题，这种过度认真会对你的生活和工作产生负面影响。你的犹豫不决，会浪费你宝贵的时间和精力。幸好 FOBO 是可以被克服的。秘诀是：&lt;strong&gt;在做出每一个决定前，你都要确定该选项的风险大小，这样你也能因此制定抉择策略。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;归结起来，你只要面临三类决定 —— 高风险、低风险、无风险。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;无风险选项&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#无风险选项&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 无风险选项&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;首先来看无风险（No Stakes）选项，生活中有些细节，永远没有正确答案，几小时后你甚至不会记得你做出了这个决定。一个很好的例子就是选择看什么节目，电视节目成千上万，足以让你迷失其中，但不管你选择哪个节目，都不会有什么后果。无风险决定的关键在于&lt;strong&gt;听天由命&lt;/strong&gt;，比如说，你可以将选择精简为两种，然后通过掷硬币来帮你做决定。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img data-src=&#34;/images/guide/fobo-no-stakes.jpg&#34; width=&#34;600&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;低风险选项&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#低风险选项&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 低风险选项&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;然后来看看低风险（Low Stakes）选项，这些决定会有后果，但后果不严重。这些选项的结果大多可以接受，很多生活中的日常，比如买哪台打印机、订哪家酒店，这些在本质上都是低风险决定。这些决定需要你做出思考，但就算做错也没啥大不了，你过几周可能就会忘记此事。你也可以再玩一次 “听天由命”，但你会想要认真思考一番，因为毕竟还是存在风险。这一次你可以&lt;strong&gt;听 “人” 由命&lt;/strong&gt;，先设下一些基本标准，然后请他人提出建议，并听从这些建议。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img data-src=&#34;/images/guide/fobo-low-stakes.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;600&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;高风险选项&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#高风险选项&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 高风险选项&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;现在你把无风险和低风险选项都解决了，你已经把时间和空间都腾给了高风险（High Stakes）选项。例如 “在哪里买房”、“找哪份工作” 等问题，因为风险高，你必定想做出正确决定。首先&lt;strong&gt;凭直觉选出一个最佳选项&lt;/strong&gt;，然后将其他选项与该最佳选择进行&lt;strong&gt;逐一比较&lt;/strong&gt;，从两个选项中选出一个并淘汰另一个。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-src=&#34;/images/guide/fobo-high-stakes.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这里有一个避开 FOBO 的秘诀，&lt;strong&gt;不要让已被淘汰的选项再次出现！&lt;/strong&gt; 如果你不停地 “复活” 淘汰选项，你将陷入纠结之中。重复刚才的步骤直到你得出最终选择，如果你遵循这一流程，你通常能靠自己做出选择，除非你遇到的情况相当罕见。如果是这样的话，你不妨把最终决定权交由一群可靠的、你信任的人，这些人还需要有能力就此话题向你提供指导意见，人数不要超过 5 人，而且最好是奇数，因为一旦出现平票状况，就会有人一锤定音。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;最后&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#最后&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 最后&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;现在你已经做出了选择，但还剩下一个挑战，就是执行这一选择，&lt;strong&gt;努力让它成为真正的最佳选择&lt;/strong&gt;。&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>【急救知识】CPR 心肺复苏术</title>
        <link rel="alternate" href="https://luhuadong.com/healthy/cpr.html"/>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;心肺复苏术&lt;/strong&gt;（Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, 简称 CPR）是针对心脏病突发、溺水、触电等各种原因导致的心脏骤停患者，主要包括&lt;strong&gt;胸外按压&lt;/strong&gt;和&lt;strong&gt;人工呼吸&lt;/strong&gt;，供给心脑重要脏器血流和氧气。大量实践表明，心跳停止 4 分钟内进行心肺复苏，患者救活率可达到 50％，而超过这一时间，被救活的希望就很渺茫。因此被称为 “黄金抢救四分钟”。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-src=&#34;/images/healthy/news_cpr_covid.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;步骤&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#步骤&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 步骤&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CPR 的步骤及要点如下：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;判断意识。&lt;/strong&gt; 发现有人突然倒地，在环境安全，自我防护做好的情况下，迅速判断伤员意识。轻拍伤员肩膀、大声呼喊询问情况，看是否有意识；如果丧失意识，进一步观察颈部脉搏是否正常，胸腔是否有起伏。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;呼救。&lt;/strong&gt; 若无意识及呼吸，或仅有喘息，赶紧呼救，同时拨打 120 急救电话。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;翻转伤员。&lt;/strong&gt; 将伤员调整成仰卧位，让其躺在坚硬的平面上，调整时注意承托头部及受伤部位。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;按压胸部。&lt;/strong&gt; 双手掌根重叠，在伤员胸部正中乳头连线中点垂直向下按压，频率每分钟至少 100 次，按压深度 4-6 厘米，连续按压 30 次。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;人工呼吸。&lt;/strong&gt; 按压 30 次后，用仰头举颌法使其鼻孔朝天以打开气道，清理口腔异物，救助者嘴唇包严伤者嘴唇（可以拿纱布、手帕隔开），口对口吹气两次，每次吹气时间大于 1 秒，吹气时观察胸腔是否有起伏。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;重复&lt;/strong&gt;按压胸部和人工呼吸，直到伤员恢复意识或 120 急救到达现场。&lt;/li&gt;
