Two years is nothing, but at the same time, a lot can be accomplished in two years. You can try a sport you've always wanted to start, and become a great at it.

两年时间不算什么，但在这段时间里，我们可以做很多事情。你可以尝试练习一项你一直想要开始的运动，然后成为一名高手。

Two years is nothing and extremely easy to waste.

but with small actions , substantial commitment and consistency, you can make it count, a lot.

两年的时间不算什么，也很容易浪费掉，但只要有微小的行动、实质性的付出和坚持，你就可以让它变得更有价值。

Two years being passive is a blink of an eye. Two years moving towards goals every single day is plenty of time. It's just a matter of perspective.

消极度日，两年转眼即逝。每天有目标地前进，两年就意味着更多的时间。这仅仅是看问题的角度不同而已。

There is nothing that cannot be accomplished in two years with enough effort.

如果足够努力，没有什么事情是两年内不能实现的。

**Start something you've wanted to do.**

**开始做你一直想做的事情。**

You're not too old for the things you were dreaming of doing when you were a kid. You can still do extreme sports if you wish to. You can start playing a musical instrument. You can become a photographer. In two years from now, you'll be great at it if you really want to.

对你年少时的梦想来说，你永远不会太老。只要你想，你还是能去做极限运动。你还是能去学习乐器。你还是能成为一名摄影师。从现在起的两年时间，只要你真的想要，你就能变得很厉害。

Don't let your past indicate who you are. You don't have to be the same person you have always been. Don't let fear control you. Don't let the social standards conform you. Age is just a number.

不要让你的过去决定你是谁。你也不必一直和以前一样。不要让恐惧支配你。不要让社会标准囚禁你。年龄只是个数字而已。

We should all empower our uniqueness and fight against our own limitations.

我们所有人都应赋予我们独特性，并与自己的局限作斗争。

By doing things you love on daily basis even for a few minutes, you'll learn to enjoy the journey.

每天去做你喜欢做的事情，哪怕只有几分钟，你也会享受这个过程。

or simply drinking more water, walking the stairs or biking to the office, you can do wonders. It's not about the end goal, it's about daily actions towards it.

再或是多喝点水，爬楼梯或骑脚踏车上班，你就会创造奇迹了。这么做不是为了简单地达到目标，而是为了每天都能够朝这个方向进步。

It's also the reason why morning routines, or ten minutes daily meditation sessions are bringing such great changes in terms of mood, productivity, stress management, ect.

这也是为什么早间的习惯和十分钟的每日冥想都能带给人巨大的改变，比如情绪、生产力和压力管理能力的改善。

**Silence your ego**

**压制你的自负**

Be kind with people. Start with your family, don't go mad one more time. Stop judging, see the good in them, and remember that you love them more than anything.

善待他人，再也不要和家人发火。停止批判，看见他们好的那面，并记得你爱他们超过一切。

In your working life, being kind and nice can bring you more respect from people who surround you than being bossy and aggressive. Learn to say 'No' often (for the right reasons), people will accept it more and value your 'Yes' more, because your times' value will increase.

在职场上，与人为善，相比发号施令和争强好胜，这会让你周围的人更尊重你。学会在正当理由下多说“不”，这样人们会更容易接受，且更看重你说的“好”，因为你的时间价值会增加。

You don't need to be scary to be respected. It's about building trust and healthy long term relationships. Try this and in two years from now your reality will be so different. Silence your ego, love and trust others enough for two years, harvest for ten years or more.

你不用通过变得吓人去获得尊重。重点是要建立起相互信任且健康的长期关系。试试看，从现在开始起的两年，你的生活将会变得大不同。用两年时间去压制你的自负，去爱和信任他人，十年甚至更长的时间你都会因此受益。

**Set long term goals and do small actions everyday towards them.**

**设定一个长期的目标，然后坚持每天即便是微小的行动。**

It has a lot to do with setting goals, but goals without actions are just wishes. The easiest way to reach goals is through daily and consistent small (even tiny) actions. It's all about consistency, commitment, and regularity. Success is not an event, it's a process and a mindset.

这和目标的设定有很大的关系，但光有目标没有行动就只能是美好的愿望而已。最简单达成目标的方法就是，每天都坚持微小的行动。一切都在于要建立一致性、要坚持付出和养成规律。成功不是一个偶然事件，它是个长久的过程和心态。

Small actions are putting you in the position of succeeding. Small actions make huge differences.

微小的行动能让你走向成功的道路。微小的行动能带来巨大的改变。

Look at yourself in the mirror in two years and you'll think 'that was quick'.

两年后在镜子中看看自己，你会想“时间过的真快”。

**Every day counts.**

**每一天都很重要。**
